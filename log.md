### Day 5: Januari 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
- Created a test driven rest API with a JSON file mocked backend

**Thoughts** I thought that the setup would be much more difficult but it seems it fairly simple.
Gonna push a MongoDB under that rest API. No, I'm gonna look at GraphQL

### Day 7: Januari 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Followed a better guide on how to build a graphQL node server.

**Thoughts** So far it seams pretty easy and straightforward to setup a graphQL api. Can't wait to use it in a real application

### Day 9: Januari 14, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Trying to remember how to setup a local mongoDB but failing miserably. Following a guide on how to set it up.

**Thoughts** 2 years have gone by and i remember little of mongoDB. What has become of me?

1. [CRUD application with node MongoDB and express](https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/)

### Day 10: Januari 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Began from scratch with a TDD express Node MongoDB es5 server.

**Thoughts** I have gotten so used to writing Typescript that I'm gonna rewrite my server and unit tests in TS

### Day 12: Januari 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Created unit tests and a GET endpoint for the questions API

**Thoughts** It seems sending a 404 really throws an error and doesn't resolves the request but rejects it

**Today's Progress**: Pulled in firebase to be my backend in my express server

### Day 15: Januari 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Created the first route to post questions

**Thoughts** Debugging a node application works great with node-inspector but it's a hassle to constantly stop and start the inspector. Gonna make a watch script for it.
Or maybe there is an easier way to debug an express application.
