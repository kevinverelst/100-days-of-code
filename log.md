# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Januari 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gotten back to work further on a concept of a ng2 quiz to easily improve knowledge about a subject in a playful way

### Day 4: Januari 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:

### Day 5: Januari 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 
- Created a test driven rest API with a JSON file mocked backend

**Thoughts** I thought that the setup would be much more difficult but it seems it fairly simple.
Gonna push a MongoDB under that rest API. No, I'm gonna look at GraphQL
